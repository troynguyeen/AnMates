# Shared Memory — Instructions & Directory Structure

This is the **single source of truth** for AnMates project memory. Every Claude session (main assistant + sub-agents) reads from here on start and writes back on finish.

If you only read one file, read **this one** — it explains the entire layout and how to use it.

## Access from Anywhere

**Canonical physical location:** `c:\AnM\AnMates\.claude\shared-memory\`

**Access path that works regardless of cwd:** `.claude/shared-memory/`

### Static knowledge vs Runtime — what goes where?

| Category | Purpose | Mutability | Source of truth |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Static knowledge** (`KNOWLEDGE-INDEX` + product/architecture/design/decisions/glossary/task-board) | Phase 1 spec — what we're building and how | Read-only for agents; only main assistant updates when handoff doc evolves | `plan/lastest/handoff/anmate-design-handoff.md` |
| **Runtime** (`current-task`, `plan`, `decisions`, `blockers`, `changelog`, `api-contracts`) | What's happening right now in active agent work | Written every session | The agents themselves |
| **Resolutions** | Verified fixes for recurring problems | Append-only; only after user confirms | User confirmation |
| **Sessions / QA reports / Screenshots** | Historical record of what happened | Append-only journal | Each session/run |

---

## How Claude uses this directory

### ON START of every session (BEFORE responding to user)

```
1. Read INSTRUCTIONS.md (this file)
2. Read current-task.md   — what's active
3. Read blockers.md        — known open issues
4. Read tail ~20 lines of changelog.md — recent activity
5. Skim resolutions/INDEX.md tags + error-keywords
   → if user's question matches a tag/error → read the full R-NNN file
6. Announce: "📥 Loaded shared-memory: <files-read>, resolutions matched: <R-NNN or none>"
```

**Why this order:** resolutions are the highest-signal context — solved problems with verified fixes. Always check them before re-investigating.

### ON FINISH of a session that resolves an issue

Two write paths depending on confidence:

| Confidence | Write to |
|------------|----------|
| User explicitly confirmed "it works" / "done" / "ok ngon" | **`resolutions/R-NNN-<slug>.md`** + session log + index |
| Work done but not yet user-verified | `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` only (move to `resolutions/` later when confirmed) |

**Resolution write protocol:**
1. Pick next free `R-NNN` (zero-padded 3 digits) from `resolutions/INDEX.md`.
2. Copy `resolutions/TEMPLATE.md` → `resolutions/R-NNN-<short-kebab-slug>.md`.
3. Fill in frontmatter (tags, platforms, severity, date, confirmed_by) and all template sections.
4. Append new row to `resolutions/INDEX.md` **Resolutions Table**.
5. Add Error-keyword mapping if user's error string is grep-able.
6. Re-use existing tags from `resolutions/INDEX.md` Tag glossary; only add new tags if essential.
7. Append row to `changelog.md` mentioning the new resolution ID.
8. If a blocker was resolved → update `blockers.md` (Status → resolved, link R-NNN).
9. If `current-task.md` was the issue → update Status to `done`, link R-NNN.

### ON FINISH of any other session producing deliverables

Just write a `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` log + append `changelog.md` row. No resolution entry until confirmed.

## File ownership

| File / Dir | Primary writers | Readers |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this) | main assistant (when conventions evolve) | all |
| `INDEX.md`, `KNOWLEDGE-INDEX.md` | main assistant; rarely changed | all (on start) |
| `USAGE.md`, `ORCHESTRATION-README.md` | main assistant | all |
| **Static-knowledge files** (`product-summary`, `architecture-overview`, `api-contracts-summary`, `domain-glossary`, `design-system`, `design-reference-index`, `shared-decisions`, `task-board`) | main assistant (re-derived from `plan/lastest/handoff/`) | all agents (read-only) |
| `current-task.md` | team-leader, main assistant | all |
| `plan.md` | team-leader | coder, qa |
| `decisions.md` | team-leader, main assistant | all |
| `blockers.md` | coder, qa raise; team-leader resolves | all |
| `changelog.md` | **all agents** (append-only on finish) | all |
| `api-contracts.md` | coder (when endpoints ship) | qa |
| `resolutions/` | main assistant (only after user confirmation) | all (lookup on start) |
| `sessions/` | main assistant (chronological log) | human review; rarely read by agents |
| `qa-reports/` | qa | team-leader, human review |
| `screenshots/` | qa | qa (compares latest vs baseline) |

---

## Resolutions vs Sessions — what goes where?

| Aspect | `resolutions/` | `sessions/` |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Trigger | User explicitly confirmed fix works | Any session producing deliverables |
| Lifecycle | Permanent reference | Time-stamped journal |
| Naming | `R-NNN-<slug>.md` (sequential ID) | `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (date) |
| Structure | Strict template (frontmatter + standard sections) | Free-form session log |
| Indexed | Yes — by tag, error keyword, platform | No — browse by date |
| Read on start | **Yes — primary lookup** | Only if topic matches by filename |
| Purpose | "If this problem recurs, here is the verified fix" | "What happened on this day" |

**Rule of thumb:** if Claude future-self might be asked the same question again, the answer belongs in `resolutions/`. Diagnostic notes, planning, exploration → `sessions/`.

---

## Query patterns Claude should use

When user describes a problem, scan in this order:

1. **Exact error string** — search `resolutions/INDEX.md` "Error keywords" section
2. **Tag match** — match keywords in user's question against Tag column
3. **Platform filter** — narrow to relevant platform if mentioned (web / android / ios / backend)
4. **Severity sort** — blockers first; address them before nice-to-haves
5. **Read full R-NNN file** — DON'T propose a new fix without reading the existing one first
6. **Adapt if needed** — if symptoms match 90% but not exactly, reference the existing resolution and explain the variant

If no resolution matches, fall back to:
- `decisions.md` (architectural constraints in effect)
- `sessions/` (browse recent dates for similar topics)
- General investigation (then write a new resolution after user confirms)

## Quick reference card

```
NEED CONTEXT?         → resolutions/INDEX.md (tags + error keywords)
WHAT'S ACTIVE?        → current-task.md
WHAT'S STUCK?         → blockers.md
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?   → changelog.md (tail)
WHAT'S DECIDED?       → decisions.md (runtime) + shared-decisions.md (15 locked Phase 1)
WHAT ARE WE BUILDING? → KNOWLEDGE-INDEX.md → product-summary.md
WHAT'S THE API?       → api-contracts-summary.md (canonical) + api-contracts.md (live mirror)
WHAT'S THE DESIGN?    → design-system.md + design-reference-index.md
WHAT TASKS REMAIN?    → task-board.md
HOW DO I DISPATCH?    → USAGE.md (agent team docs)

DONE A FIX?
  USER CONFIRMED?     → write resolutions/R-NNN + update INDEX + changelog
  NOT YET CONFIRMED?  → write sessions/YYYY-MM-DD + update changelog
  RESOLVED BLOCKER?   → update blockers.md status → resolved
```
